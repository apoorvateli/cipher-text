# cipher-text

## Problem Statement

You have an ordinary word and you have to replace the consonants with the consonant doubled and with an “o” in between.   
So the consonant “b” is replaced by “bob”, “r” is replaced by “ror”, and so on.   
Vowels are to be changed to another matching vowel, the vowel map is given below.

‘A’,’a’   => ‘E’,’e’

‘E’,’e’   => ‘I’,’i’

‘I’,’i’     => ‘O’,’o’

‘O’, ‘o’ => ‘U’, ‘u’

‘U’,’u’  => ‘A’,’a’

 

For eg., a word like, ‘SECRET’ should be encoded to ‘SoSICoCRoRIToT’. Similarly the word ‘SoSICoCRoRIToT’, should be decoded to ‘SECRET’.

Write a program in any language, to encode a string and decode the ciphered text.
